# Materialist GES Implementation Roadmap
# =====================================

## Phase 1: Theoretical Foundation
✅ Implement dialectical analysis engine
✅ Create material conditions data sources
✅ Establish class consciousness analysis methods

## Phase 2: Data Integration
✅ Integrate real economic data APIs (World Bank API with direct HTTP requests)
✅ Build labor statistics aggregation pipeline
✅ Implement inequality tracking (Gini, wealth concentration)
✅ Create alienation measurement proxies
✅ Establish collective action monitoring

## Phase 3: Historical Analysis
- [ ] Build historical materialism trajectory analysis
- [ ] Implement crisis prediction based on contradiction intensity
- [ ] Create revolutionary potential forecasting
- [ ] Develop class consciousness trend analysis
- [ ] Build solidarity network mapping

## Phase 4: Visualization & Interface
- [ ] Create materialist visualizations with:
  - Class struggle intensity heatmaps
  - Contradiction trajectory plots
  - Historical momentum indicators
  - Crisis warning dashboards
- [ ] Build materialist analysis dashboards
- [ ] Create dialectical contradiction visualizations

## Phase 5: Validation & Deployment
- [ ] Validate against historical revolutionary periods
- [ ] Test crisis prediction accuracy
- [ ] Compare against bourgeois sentiment analysis
- [ ] Deploy for collective organizing support

## Data Sources Priority List
1. Labor statistics (strikes, unions, wages vs productivity)
2. Wealth inequality (Gini, top 1%, CEO ratios)
3. Class structure analysis (occupation, ownership)
4. Alienation proxies (job satisfaction, social isolation)
5. Consciousness indicators (political mobilization, collective action)
6. Material welfare (housing, healthcare, subsistence)
7. Ideological influence (media concentration, education access)

## Key Metrics to Track
- Class antagonism intensity (-1 to 1)
- Revolutionary potential (0-1)
- Solidarity levels (0-1)
- Alienation intensity (0-1)
- Crisis indicators (qualitative list)
- Historical momentum (-1 to 1)
- Consciousness type (enum: class/false/revolutionary/reified)

## Theoretical Validation Benchmarks
- Predict historical revolutionary periods (1848, 1917, 1968, 2011)
- Identify current crisis indicators accurately
- Track actual class consciousness development
- Correlate with real social movement intensity
