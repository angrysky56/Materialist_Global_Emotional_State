"""Theoretical Weighting Schemes for Materialist Indicators.

This module addresses the challenge of quantifying qualitative Marxist theory
by providing theoretically-grounded weighting schemes for different indicators.

Based on:
1. Marx's analysis of primary vs secondary contradictions
2. Historical materialism hierarchy of determining factors
3. Dialectical relationships between base and superstructure
